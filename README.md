# Hand Gesture Recognition Using CNN

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize and classify different hand gestures from image data. The goal of the project is to create a system that enables intuitive human-computer interaction by accurately identifying gestures. This could be useful for applications like gesture-based control systems, gaming interfaces, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Leap Gest Recog Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog). The dataset consists of thousands of grayscale images of various hand gestures, divided into different classes.

Each image in the dataset corresponds to one of the following gestures:

- Pointing
- Palm
- Fist
- Thumbs up
- Other gestures

The dataset has the following structure:

- **Person ID**: Identifier for the person performing the gesture
- **Label**: The corresponding hand gesture label
- **Image Data**: Grayscale image representing the gesture
